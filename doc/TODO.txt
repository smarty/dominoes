The purpose of dominoes is to facilitate deterministic shutdown of an application instance running
inside of a given application process.

One thing this can enable is the ability to run two concurrent instance of an application inside of
the same process. This could be the result of a config file change, e.g. new configuration values
being written by a configuration agent updating the config file. When a config file changes, we
would want to start up a new instance of the application inside the process and then shut down the
old/previous instance.

The library has the potential to facilitate this outcome by having a Listener that is injected into
the end (inner-most part) of the dominoes pipeline of the new application instance. Once that Listen
is invoked, it would then trigger a Close() invocation to then shutdown the old instance.
